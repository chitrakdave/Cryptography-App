🔐 **Cryptography-App**

This project demonstrates the implementation and performance analysis of various cryptographic algorithms — including AES, RSA, DSA, and Hashing — using Python’s PyCryptodome library.
It also includes a utility to generate dummy files of different sizes for encryption and hashing tests.
