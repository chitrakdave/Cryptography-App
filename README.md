🔐 **Cryptography-App**

This project demonstrates the implementation and performance analysis of various cryptographic algorithms — including AES, RSA, DSA, and Hashing — using Python’s PyCryptodome library.
It also includes a utility to generate dummy files of different sizes for encryption and hashing tests.

⚙️ **Features**

AES Encryption/Decryption

Supports CBC and CTR modes

Tests with 128-bit and 256-bit keys

RSA Encryption/Decryption

Uses PKCS1_OAEP padding

Key sizes: 2048-bit and 3072-bit

Hashing Algorithms

SHA-256

SHA-512

SHA3-256

DSA Digital Signatures

Key sizes: 2048-bit and 3072-bit

Uses DSS (Digital Signature Standard) for signing and verification

Performance Metrics

Measures execution time (in nanoseconds or microseconds)

Calculates speed per byte for encryption, decryption, hashing, and signing
